- User: [[tool:librarySearch:Search Workspace]]Can you tell me the document generation + admin related all snowflake generated artifacts are in which file?

- Anara: Yes — I checked the generated Snowflake document‑generation + Admin artifacts and mapped the main files and where they live in the repo bundle. Below is a grouped, developer‑friendly list of the Snowflake artifacts (DDL, Snowpark procs, registration scripts, External Function SQL, FAISS container/index artifacts, tests and infra) with the canonical file paths you can open and run. Each line cites the delivered artifact set where that file/path is described.

Core schema & DDL
- sql/ai_feature_hub_schema.sql (canonical AI_FEATURE_HUB schema / create‑database + core tables) @76 @63  
- sql/coreschema.sql (core tables: DOCUMENT, TEMPLATE, CLAUSE, EVIDENCE_BUNDLE, BILLING tables) @270 @111

Stage / Snowpipe / ingestion helpers
- sql/snowpipe_setup.sql (FILE FORMAT, STAGE, PIPE / Snowpipe setup) @24 @276  
- sql/snowflake_bundle.sql (helper bundle / deployment notes + role/grant examples) @40 @343

Snowpark Python stored‑procedures (billing, ingest, entitlement, evidence)
- src/run_billing.py (RUN_BILLING_RUN: preview + final invoice generator) @17 @322  
- src/entitlement_check.py (entitlement check Snowpark SP) @17 @322  
- src/usage_ingest_sp.py and src/embedding_ingest_sp.py (idempotent ingestion SPs) @17 @322  
- src/write_evidence_bundle.py (evidence bundle exporter / archival SP) @17 @120

Procedure registration & deploy helpers
- register/create_procedures_register.sql (CREATE/REPLACE PROCEDURE statements) @31 @120  
- register/register_all_procs.sh (snowsql-based register script) @38 @326  
- infra/register_via_connector.py (Python connector fallback registrar) @32 @336

- infra/snowflake_provisioning.py (provision helper for stage/integration/roles) @24 @336  
- infra/deploy_snowpark_container.sh (helper to register container with Snowpark / container runtime) @17 @326

Where to start (recommended inspect order)
1) Inspect sql/ai_feature_hub_schema.sql and sql/coreschema.sql to confirm table columns and clustering @76 @270  
2) Provision stage/pipe (sql/snowpipe_setup.sql) and verify S3/SNS notifications @24 @276  
3) PUT Python files (src/) to @~ and run register/create_procedures_register.sql or infra/register_via_connector.py to register SPs @17 @31  
4) Register API_INTEGRATION + EXTERNAL FUNCTIONs (sql/external_functions_register.sql) so similarity/agent calls can be exercised @77 @14  
5) Run tests/smoke/full_acceptance_smoke.sh and pytest tests/test_deterministic_billing.py to validate invoice_hash + line_items match expectations @278 @15

If you want, I can:
- produce a one‑page manifest file (CSV) listing the exact files above with SHA or file modification timestamps for quick verification; or  
- open any specific file and paste its exact contents here so you can review before running (I already have the repo paths listed in the collected artifacts). Which would you prefer?

- User: [[tool:librarySearch:Search Workspace]]No, in which chat or notes in [anara.com](http://anara.com) is the generated code?

- Anara: Short answer — the generated implementation code lives in your Anara workspace documents and the repo artifacts packaged in the deliverables, not on the public anara.com marketing site @818 @699.

Where the generated code and runnable files are stored (key notes/docs and repo locations)
- The Avro/schema and other generated code snippets are in the AnaraGeneratedCodesdocx note in your workspace @699.  
- The Snowpark Python stored‑procedures (billing, embedding ingestion, entitlement checks), FAISS index/loader and similarity service skeleton are in the Snowflake Snowpark deliverable (AIAdminModuleSnowFlakeStepbyStepImpldocx) @164 @165.  
- The repository layout listing the canonical file paths (sql/, src/, containers/, tests/, infra/) and the file names to open is documented in the repo manifest/README delivered with the Snowflake bundle @49.  
- The External Function / API_INTEGRATION registration SQL, stage/pipe (Snowpipe) setup and provisioning helpers are in sql/external_functions_register.sql and sql/snowpipe_setup.sql (referenced in the provisioning/runbook artifacts) @26 @130.  
- The deterministic billing tests, smoke harness and CI workflow are present under tests/ and .github/workflows/ respectively (paths and test names are included in the runbook and test harness artifacts) @167 @333.

Exact file paths (copy/paste into your repo to inspect)
- sql/ai_feature_hub_schema.sql and sql/coreschema.sql (core DDL), src/run_billing.py (billing SP), src/embedding_ingest_sp.py, src/entitlement_check.py, sql/external_functions_register.sql, containers/Dockerfile.agent, faiss/index_snapshot_loader.py, tests/test_deterministic_billing.py, tests/smoke/full_acceptance_smoke.sh, infra/register_via_connector.py — these paths and their roles are listed in the repository layout and runbook @49 @333.

Context on Anara.com vs your workspace
- The public Anara website describes the product and capabilities but does not host your generated code; your generated artifacts were placed into the workspace documents and the repo artifacts listed above @818 @699.

If you want immediate verification locations I used in this mapping, inspect these workspace notes/docs now: AnaraGeneratedCodesdocx @699, AIAdminModuleSnowFlakeStepbyStepImpldocx @164 @165, and the repository/manifest listing in the Snowflake bundle (repo layout) @49.

- User: [[tool:librarySearch:Search Workspace]] No, generated code of document generation + admin in the workspace notes or chat file name

- Anara: Here are the workspace notes / chat documents that contain the generated document‑generation + admin code (file / note names you can open now), with source citations:

- AnaraGeneratedCodesdocx — contains the generated implementation/code snippets for the package. @478  
- AIAdminModuleSnowFlakeStepbyStepImpldocx — contains the Snowflake generator script, repo packaging helpers and deployment/runbook for the generated artifacts. @102 @106  
- AIAdminModuleSnowFlakeStepbyStepImpl_09092 — Snowflake-side artifacts, registration helpers and packaged stored‑proc files referenced in the generated bundle. @212 @213  
- ImplSnowflakenativeperAccAdminConsoledocx — Snowflake-native per-account Admin Console spec plus the generated DDL/Stored‑Proc and admin integration artifacts. @284 @289  
- DocGenContextAwareFeatureImplV3docx — contains generated LWC / Apex snippets for context‑aware document generation and admin integration pieces. @134 @150  
- DocGenSalesforcedocx — contains Salesforce-side generated artifacts (Apex/LWC/metadata) for document generation + admin flows referenced in the deliverables. @453  
- AdminModuleSALESFORCEImplDetailsV4docx — contains generated Admin Console LWC and FlexiPage XML examples and related generated metadata. @175  
- AIAdminModuleSFStepbyStepImpldocx — contains the step‑by‑step SFDX / LWC / Apex artifacts and the generated SFDX bundle skeleton. @438

If you want, I can paste the exact generated code (file contents) from any one of these notes/attachments here — tell me the specific note name above and I will dump its code content inline.

- User: [[tool:librarySearch:Search Workspace]]No, the file in which anara generated or outputted here,?

- Anara: The generated document‑generation + Admin code/output created here was written into the workspace note named
- AIAdminModuleSnowFlakeStepbyStepImpl_09092 — this note contains the staged PR‑style file list and the full generated Snowflake & repo artifacts (run_billing.py, Snowpark SPs, external‑function SQL, FAISS/container files, infra scripts, tests, README/runbook) @58 @61.  

A companion doc in the workspace that records the PR metadata, repo layout and delivery notes is
- AIAdminModuleSnowFlakeStepbyStepImpldocx — it contains the branch/PR metadata, file list and deployment instructions that accompany the generated files @122.  

(Those two workspace documents are the places where the Anara output/generated code was emitted in this conversation.) @58 @122

- User: But why it output / generated in AIAdminModuleSnowFlakeStepbyStepImpldocx or AIAdminModuleSnowFlakeStepbyStepImpl_09092 but why it not output in Snowflake-DocGen_V1.0, what prompt i need to give to generate here?

- Anara: Short answer: Snowflake-DocGen_V1.0 currently only contains its title and no generated artifacts, which is why the generator output was written into the other workspace notes instead @1. I could not find any workspace or runbook file in the provided documents that explains the routing logic Anara uses to choose which note receives generated output, so the explanation below is a practical, actionable way you can force generation into Snowflake-DocGen_V1.0.  

What I see about the target note
- The workspace note named "Snowflake-DocGen_V1.0" exists but appears empty except for the title/header @1.  

Why generation likely went into other notes (practical possibilities)
- The generator was asked (explicitly or by default) to create a new note or to use a different existing note name.  
- The generator may prefer writing new iteration/PR-style artifacts into separate implementation notes rather than overwriting a short summary note.  
- Permission, naming, or “write-mode” (append vs overwrite vs new file) directives control where output lands.  
Note: I could not find a definitive routing rule in the supplied documents, so the above are practical likely causes rather than cited behavior from docs.

Exact prompts you can paste into Anara to make it generate its document-generation + admin artifacts into the Snowflake-DocGen_V1.0 note
- Overwrite the note (replace existing content):
  Please generate the full document‑generation and admin code artifacts for the Snowflake implementation and write them directly into the workspace note named "Snowflake-DocGen_V1.0". Overwrite any existing content in that note. Include:
  - file list (paths and filenames)
  - each file's full contents (for code files include exact code)
  - a manifest table showing filename, SHA256 (or placeholder), and brief purpose line
  - a short runbook with step-by-step deploy/register commands
  Do not create any new notes; write only to "Snowflake-DocGen_V1.0".

- Append to the note (preserve existing header and add full artifact bundle):
  Please append the full generated Snowflake document‑generation + admin artifacts to the end of the existing workspace note "Snowflake-DocGen_V1.0". Keep the original title/header intact and add a new section titled "Generated artifacts (date: YYYY-MM-DD)". Include file paths, full file contents, and a manifest as above. Do not create or write to other notes.

- Create a new version and link back (if you want a separate implementation snapshot):
  Create a new workspace note titled "Snowflake-DocGen_V1.0 - Generated [YYYY-MM-DD]" and write the complete generated artifacts there, then add a short pointer line in "Snowflake-DocGen_V1.0" that links to the new note. Include manifest + code in the new note.

- If you want only a manifest (no file contents), use:
  Produce a one‑page manifest and write it into "Snowflake-DocGen_V1.0". The manifest must list all generated repo files, file paths, and a one-sentence purpose for each file. Do not include full file contents.

Required clarity to include in any prompt (helps guarantee the output ends up in the correct note)
- Exact target note name: "Snowflake-DocGen_V1.0" (copy/paste to avoid typos).  
- Desired write mode: overwrite / append / create-new-version.  
- Whether you want full file contents vs manifest-only.  
- Whether to include code fences or raw text blocks (specify “include exact code, no redactions”).  
- Permission confirmation (if your workspace asks the assistant to confirm write permissions, include that confirmation).  

One compact example you can paste as a single instruction
Please generate the complete Snowflake document‑generation + Admin implementation (DDL, Snowpark stored procedures, procedure registration SQL, external function registration SQL, container artifacts, infra scripts, tests, and README) and write it into the workspace note named "Snowflake-DocGen_V1.0". Overwrite the current contents. Include a manifest (filename, path, one-line purpose) and full file contents for each artifact. Do not create or write to any other notes.

If you want, I can now:
- produce that exact prompt in a ready-to-send form; or
- if you paste the exact write-mode (overwrite/append/new-version) I will generate the full prompt tailored to your selected mode.

(Reference: the note "Snowflake-DocGen_V1.0" exists in your workspace and currently only contains its title/header) @1
